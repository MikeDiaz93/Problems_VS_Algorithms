# Problem 1:  "Finding the Square Root of an Integer" 


## Objective:

Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library. You have to find the floor value of the square root.


## Approach:


We set the min number in 1 and the max num os the number is the number we have to squared root; we squared the number and divided in to t2 until we find the correct squared root. 



## Data Structure used: 

None, because at the end we are just working with two numbers, min max numbers. 


## Efficiency :

    Time complexity:
        
        * O(logn) ->  Because we do a type of binary search and then to find the number that approximates the most possible integer                      to the result of the squared root.

    Space complexity:
    
        * O(n) -> Because we always have a finite constant number in the memory.
