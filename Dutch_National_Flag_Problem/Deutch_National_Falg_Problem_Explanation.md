# Problem  4:  "Deutch National Falg Problem " 


## Objective:

Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. 

## Approach:

Knowing we just have 0's, 1's ans 2's, we just move all the 0's to left and the 2's to right, and the 1's let them in the middle. (We just swap the 0's and 2's). 


## Data Structure used :

Lists


## Efficiency :

    Time complexity:
        
        * O(n) -> Because we just iterate once the list, besides that the sawp takes constant time. 

    Space complexity:
    
        * O(n) -> Because we just safe the complete list.
