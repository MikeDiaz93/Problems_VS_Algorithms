# Problem  6: "Unsorted Integer Array" 


## Objective: 
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers.



## Approach

To get just the min and max numbers, we compare by positions in the list starting in the 0 position, as min and max numbers, then iterate and compare them one by one through the list.  



## Data Structure used:



Lists



## Efficiency :

    Time complexity:
        
        * O(n) - > Because it comapres element by element just once. 

    Space complexity:
    
        * O(1) -> Because just save the min and max values in a list.
